//! A fast, city-scale geodesic approximation library based on Mapbox's Cheap Ruler algorithm.
//!
//! This crate provides the `CheapRuler` struct that implements fast approximations for
//! common geodesic calculations on Earth's surface, designed for city-scale distances
//! where performance is more important than absolute precision.
//!
//! The core algorithm uses a locally flat Earth approximation with latitude-dependent
//! scaling factors, offering 20-100x performance improvements over traditional methods
//! like Haversine or Vincenty's formulas while maintaining typically <0.1% error for
//! distances up to 500 km.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic distance calculation:
//!
//! ```
//! use geo_ruler::CheapRuler;
//!
//! let ruler = CheapRuler::<f64>::WGS84();
//! let empire_state = [-73.9857, 40.7484];
//! let flatiron = [-73.9897, 40.7411];
//!
//! let distance = ruler.distance(&empire_state, &flatiron);
//! println!("Distance: {:.1} meters", distance);
//! ```
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! - `geo`: Integration with the geo-rs crate ecosystem
//! - `wasm`: WebAssembly bindings for JavaScript interop
//! - `atan2_deg3`: Use 3rd degree polynomial approximation for `atan2` (faster)
//! - `atan2_deg5`: Use 5th degree polynomial approximation for `atan2` (more accurate)
