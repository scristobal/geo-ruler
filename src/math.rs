//! This module provides alternative implementations of the atan2 function to optimize performance.
//!
//! The Rust's default `atan2` function is precise but can be computationally expensive.
//! This module offers faster polynomial approximations that are suitable for applications
//! where maximum performance is desired and small errors are acceptable.
//!
//! Two implementations are available:
//! - `atan2_deg3`: A 3rd degree polynomial approximation that is faster but less accurate (typical error < 0.1 rad)
//! - `atan2_deg5`: A 5th degree polynomial approximation that offers better accuracy (typical error < 0.01 rad) with a small performance cost
//!
//! These implementations can be used by enabling the corresponding feature flags:
//! - `atan2_deg3`
//! - `atan2_deg5`
//!
//! If neither feature is enabled, Rust's default `atan2` implementation is used.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! These optimized implementations are automatically used by the `bearing` method when
//! the corresponding feature flag is enabled.
